# Exploitation

Well, if you happen to look at the local storage, you'll get the flag directly. But that's not how we got it because we're stupid. So, here's what we did.
<br />

You see a JS file in the sources: `jquery.jscroll2.js`. Now, to understand what exactly it does, we first convert the huge list on `line 1` from `hex` to `string` to be able to make sense of it. So let's convert it using `python2`.

```python
random = ["\x75\x73\x65\x20\x73\x74\x72\x69\x63\x74","\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C","\x3C\x73\x6D\x61\x6C\x6C\x3E\x4C\x6F\x61\x64\x69\x6E\x67\x2E\x2E\x2E\x3C\x2F\x73\x6D\x61\x6C\x6C\x3E","\x61\x3A\x6C\x61\x73\x74","","\x66\x6C\x61\x67","\x53\x6B\x4E\x55\x52\x6E\x74\x7A\x63\x47\x39\x76\x62\x32\x39\x76\x61\x33\x6C\x66\x5A\x32\x68\x76\x63\x33\x52\x7A\x58\x32\x6C\x75\x58\x33\x4E\x30\x62\x33\x4A\x68\x5A\x32\x56\x39","\x73\x65\x74\x49\x74\x65\x6D","\x6C\x6F\x63\x61\x6C\x53\x74\x6F\x72\x61\x67\x65","\x64\x61\x74\x61","\x66\x75\x6E\x63\x74\x69\x6F\x6E","\x64\x65\x66\x61\x75\x6C\x74\x73","\x65\x78\x74\x65\x6E\x64","\x6F\x76\x65\x72\x66\x6C\x6F\x77\x2D\x79","\x63\x73\x73","\x76\x69\x73\x69\x62\x6C\x65","\x66\x69\x72\x73\x74","\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x53\x65\x6C\x65\x63\x74\x6F\x72","\x66\x69\x6E\x64","\x62\x6F\x64\x79","\x68\x72\x65\x66","\x61\x74\x74\x72","\x20","\x63\x6F\x6E\x74\x65\x6E\x74\x53\x65\x6C\x65\x63\x74\x6F\x72","\x74\x72\x69\x6D","\x73\x72\x63","\x69\x6D\x67","\x66\x69\x6C\x74\x65\x72","\x6C\x6F\x61\x64\x69\x6E\x67\x48\x74\x6D\x6C","\x6C\x65\x6E\x67\x74\x68","\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72","\x3C\x64\x69\x76\x20\x63\x6C\x61\x73\x73\x3D\x22\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72\x22\x20\x2F\x3E","\x77\x72\x61\x70\x41\x6C\x6C","\x63\x6F\x6E\x74\x65\x6E\x74\x73","\x70\x61\x67\x69\x6E\x67\x53\x65\x6C\x65\x63\x74\x6F\x72","\x68\x69\x64\x65","\x63\x6C\x6F\x73\x65\x73\x74","\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x2D\x70\x61\x72\x65\x6E\x74","\x61\x64\x64\x43\x6C\x61\x73\x73","\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72\x2C\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x61\x64\x64\x65\x64","\x6E\x6F\x74","\x70\x61\x72\x65\x6E\x74","\x3C\x64\x69\x76\x20\x63\x6C\x61\x73\x73\x3D\x22\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x2D\x70\x61\x72\x65\x6E\x74\x22\x20\x2F\x3E","\x77\x72\x61\x70","\x75\x6E\x77\x72\x61\x70","\x63\x68\x69\x6C\x64\x72\x65\x6E","\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x61\x64\x64\x65\x64","\x72\x65\x6D\x6F\x76\x65\x44\x61\x74\x61","\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C","\x75\x6E\x62\x69\x6E\x64","\x64\x69\x76\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72","\x62\x6F\x72\x64\x65\x72\x54\x6F\x70\x57\x69\x64\x74\x68","\x70\x61\x64\x64\x69\x6E\x67\x54\x6F\x70","\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x54\x6F\x70","\x74\x6F\x70","\x6F\x66\x66\x73\x65\x74","\x68\x65\x69\x67\x68\x74","\x63\x65\x69\x6C","\x77\x61\x69\x74\x69\x6E\x67","\x70\x61\x64\x64\x69\x6E\x67","\x6F\x75\x74\x65\x72\x48\x65\x69\x67\x68\x74","\x69\x6E\x66\x6F","\x6A\x53\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x3A","\x66\x72\x6F\x6D\x20\x62\x6F\x74\x74\x6F\x6D\x2E\x20\x4C\x6F\x61\x64\x69\x6E\x67\x20\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x20\x72\x65\x71\x75\x65\x73\x74\x2E\x2E\x2E","\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x48\x72\x65\x66","\x77\x61\x72\x6E","\x6A\x53\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x3A\x20\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x53\x65\x6C\x65\x63\x74\x6F\x72\x20\x6E\x6F\x74\x20\x66\x6F\x75\x6E\x64\x20\x2D\x20\x64\x65\x73\x74\x72\x6F\x79\x69\x6E\x67","\x61\x75\x74\x6F\x54\x72\x69\x67\x67\x65\x72","\x61\x75\x74\x6F\x54\x72\x69\x67\x67\x65\x72\x55\x6E\x74\x69\x6C","\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C","\x62\x69\x6E\x64","\x63\x6C\x69\x63\x6B\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C","\x3C\x64\x69\x76\x20\x63\x6C\x61\x73\x73\x3D\x22\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x6C\x6F\x61\x64\x69\x6E\x67\x22\x3E","\x3C\x2F\x64\x69\x76\x3E","\x68\x74\x6D\x6C","\x6C\x61\x73\x74","\x3C\x64\x69\x76\x20\x63\x6C\x61\x73\x73\x3D\x22\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x61\x64\x64\x65\x64\x22\x20\x2F\x3E","\x61\x70\x70\x65\x6E\x64","\x65\x72\x72\x6F\x72","\x72\x65\x6D\x6F\x76\x65","\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x6E\x65\x78\x74\x2D\x70\x61\x72\x65\x6E\x74","\x63\x61\x6C\x6C\x62\x61\x63\x6B","\x63\x61\x6C\x6C","\x64\x69\x72","\x6C\x6F\x61\x64","\x64\x69\x76\x2E\x6A\x73\x63\x72\x6F\x6C\x6C\x2D\x61\x64\x64\x65\x64","\x61\x6E\x69\x6D\x61\x74\x65","\x64\x65\x62\x75\x67","\x6F\x62\x6A\x65\x63\x74","\x61\x70\x70\x6C\x79","\x6C\x6F\x67","\x73\x6C\x69\x63\x65","\x70\x72\x6F\x74\x6F\x74\x79\x70\x65","\x66\x6E","\x69\x6E\x69\x74\x69\x61\x6C\x69\x7A\x65\x64","\x65\x61\x63\x68"]

code = ''

    code +='\n'+ bytes(line)
print(code)
```

Once you run this script, you get a huge list, of which we'll display the first few items here.

```bash
$ python2 ~/Downloads/Dump/test.py

use strict
jscroll
<small>Loading...</small>
a:last

flag
SkNURntzcG9vb29va3lfZ2hvc3RzX2luX3N0b3JhZ2V9
setItem
localStorage
data
function
defaults
extend
```

Now we can try to make sense of the rest of the code. We see a line:

```javascript
window[_0xbcec[8]][_0xbcec[7]](_0xbcec[5], atob(_0xbcec[6]));
```

Now that we have the strings figured out, we can translate this to:

```javascript
window['localstorage']['setItem']('flag', atob('SkNURntzcG9vb29va3lfZ2hvc3RzX2luX3N0b3JhZ2V9'))
```

So the script basically converst the `base64` string `SkNURntzcG9vb29va3lfZ2hvc3RzX2luX3N0b3JhZ2V9` and stores it in local storage with the key `flag`. Well, now you can just check the local storage, or just convert this string to ASCII using your terminal.

```bash
$ echo "SkNURntzcG9vb29va3lfZ2hvc3RzX2luX3N0b3JhZ2V9" | base64 -d
JCTF{spoooooky_ghosts_in_storage}
```

The flag is:

```
JCTF{spoooooky_ghosts_in_storage}
```
